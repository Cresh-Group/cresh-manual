## Meaning of rating

We decided to present the results of our complex analysis in the form of a school evaluation. An idea can receive a grade from A to F. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective analysis generated using AI algorithms and may not be objective.

Meaning of the grade:
 * S - top idea highly recommended to development,
 * A - recommended for development,
 * B - may go forward, but need to collect more data,
 * C - recommended to go forward, returns likely modest,
 * D - doubtful, further development not recommended,
 * F - strongly recommend to stop further development.

Evaluation depends on the obtained values of the analysis metrics. You can find the exact list of obtained metrics below.

## Detail view

However, we see the greatest value in the detailed view, which includes explanations of the ratings given and suggestions related to them. Everything is presented in charts that allow intuitive evaluation of the idea.
